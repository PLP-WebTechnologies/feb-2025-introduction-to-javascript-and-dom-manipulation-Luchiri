# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Objectives
This project demonstrates how to:
- Write basic JavaScript functions.
- Dynamically manipulate the DOM.
- Respond to user interactions like clicks

## Features

- Dynamic Text Content: Changes an element's text using Javascript.
- Style Modification: Alters the CSS styles of elements when a button is clicked.
- Element Creation & Removal: Adds and removes elements when a button is clicked.
- Semantic HTML5 Structure: Includes at least 5 different semantic HTML5 elements.

# Files Used
- index.html - A well structured HTML5 document using semantic elements.
- script.js - JavaScript file handling DOM manipulation and user events.
  
# How It Works
- Link script.js to the HTML file.

When the user clicks the button:
- The text inside a heading is updated.
- CSS styles (color)  are changed.
- An element (paragraph) is dynamically added or removed from the DOM.
